    "Plash provides a straightforward approach to persistent data storage for your applications. This explainer will help you understand how data storage works and best practices for managing your application data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `data/` Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important concept to understand is the special `data/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files in the `data/` directory are **preserved** between deployments\n",
    "- All other files in your project are **replaced** with each new deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior allows you to update your application code while preserving your database and other persistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Database Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "For most applications, we recommend using SQLite for persistent storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of configuring a SQLite database path\n",
    "DB_PATH = \"data/prod.db\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By placing your SQLite database file in the `data/` directory, you ensure it persists between deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `plash_deploy`, Plash will preserve only the contents of the `data/` directory on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-warning title=\"Be careful when including a local `data/` directory in your deployment files\"}\n",
    "If you upload files in a local `data/` directory, they will overwrite any existing files with the same names in your production environment. Consider using environment variables to manage different database paths for development and production.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment-Based Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `PLASH_PRODUCTION` environment variable (automatically set to `1` in your Plash environment) to modify your app's behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "DB_PATH = \"data/prod.db\" if os.getenv(\"PLASH_PRODUCTION\") else \"local.db\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backing Up Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download all your application files (including your data) by using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "plash_download\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For critical applications, consider setting up automated backups. For example, using a cron job:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Example cron job for daily backups\n",
    "0 0 * * * plash_download --path /path/to/project --save_path /path/to/backups/$(date +\\%Y\\%m\\%d)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clearing Production Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to completely reset your application's data, you can delete and recreate the application. This will permanently remove all associated data, so ensure you have backups if needed."
