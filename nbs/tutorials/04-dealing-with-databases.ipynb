    "For apps that use persistent storage, we recommend sqlite. The docker container your app runs in has a working directory of /app which is a volume mounted to a folder that we hourly backup. Therefore, we recommend placing your sqlite database somewhere in that directory. Note when redeploying an app with plash_deploy, we automatically overwrite existing files with the same name as those uploaded. Therefore to prevent data loss, ensure any local database files do not clash with any deployed database names that your app may set up. You can use the environment variable `PLASH_PRODUCTION`, which we automatically set to 1 in your Plash container, to modify your apps behavior for local and production development. You can download any deployed database names by clicking the Download App button to get a compressed file of all files in your /app folder in your deployed app.\n"
