Therefore to prevent data loss, ensure any local database files do not clash with any deployed database names that your app may set up. You can use the environment variable `PLASH_PRODUCTION`, which we automatically set to 1 in your Plash container, to modify your apps behavior for local and production development. You can download any deployed database names by clicking the Download App button to get a compressed file of all files in your /app folder in your deployed app.\n"
