    "By default, when you first deploy a Plash app, it automatically receives a randomized Plash subdomain (like `https://your-fasthtml-app-83k.pla.sh`).\n",
    "\n",
    "On this page you will learn how to customize your app's domain in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Custom pla.sh subdomain\n",
    "2. Bring your own domain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom pla.sh subdomain\n",
    "\n",
    "When you deploy a Plash app for the first time, a `.plash` file is created in your project root directory. This file contains your app's configuration, including the app name which determines your subdomain:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "export PLASH_APP_NAME='your-fasthtml-app-83k'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To customize your Plash subdomain:\n",

    "1. Open the `.plash` file in your project directory\n",
    "2. Edit the `PLASH_APP_NAME` value to your preferred subdomain name\n",
    "3. Redeploy your app with `plash_deploy`\n",
    "4. Go to the dashboard to delete your old app or use `plash_delete --name <old_name>`\n",

    "2. Select your domain\n",

    "#### Namecheap\n",
    "1. Log in to your Namecheap account\n",
    "2. Go to Domain List and click \"Manage\" next to your domain\n",
    "3. Navigate to the \"Advanced DNS\" tab\n",
    "4. Add a CNAME record:\n",
    "   - Type: CNAME Record\n",
    "   - Host: Your subdomain (or @ for root domain)\n",
    "   - Value: pla.sh\n",
    "   - TTL: Automatic\n",

    "1. Running `plash_view` to open your app in the browser\n",
    "2. Checking that your app loads correctly at your custom domain"
