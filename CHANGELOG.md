# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 0.0.5

### New Features

- add flag to specify app id when deploying ([#12](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/plash_cli/issues/12))

- Option to fetch build or app logs in the CLI ([#8](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/plash_cli/pull/8)), thanks to [@pydanny](https://github.com/pydanny)
  - This changes the following:

1. Provides a new option for display of logs, specifically the build logs
2. Defaults the log to output build logs, rather than app logs

This change will make it easier to investigate failed deployments and other problems

This change is dependant on a forthcoming change to Plash.
