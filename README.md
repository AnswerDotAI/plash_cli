## What is Plash

Plash is a next-generation deployment platform for fast, hassle-free
Python application hosting. It’s designed to be:

- **Simple and streamlined** - deploy your applications with minimal
  configuration
- **Developer-focused** - built for coders, not cloud engineers
- **Fast and efficient** - get your app online in seconds, not days

Plash handles all the deployment complexities so you can focus on what
matters: building great applications. With Plash, you can deploy any
Python app using straightforward commands and configurations, letting
you ship your work quickly and reliably.

Whether you’re building web services, APIs, data applications, or tools,
Plash provides the infrastructure backbone so you can concentrate on
creating a splash with your code.

## Deploy your first app

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy your first app. This
tutorial will explore the basics of using Plash and help you get
familiar with it at a high level.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Install the Commandline Interface (CLI)
- [ ] Login via the CLI
- [ ] Create your app files
- [ ] Deploy your app
- [ ] Visit your app

**Prerequisites:**

- A registered account at https://pla.sh
- Basic terminal / command line skills
- Basic text editor skills

### Installation

Install Plash CLI with pip:

``` sh
pip install plash-cli
```

That’s it! This command installs the Plash command-line interface, which
you’ll use to deploy your applications.

✅ Complete: Install the Commandline Interface (CLI)

### CLI Login

Authenticate with your Plash account:

``` sh
plash login
```

This command opens your browser to authenticate with your Plash account.
After completing the login process, you’ll see a “complete” confirmation
page in your browser.

Return to your terminal where you’ll find the confirmation message:

> Authentication successful! Config saved to
> <your-global-config-path>/plash_config.json

✅ Complete: Login via the CLI

### Create your first app

Create a new directory for your first app:

``` bash
mkdir -p plash-tutorial
cd plash-tutorial
```

Now let’s create the `main.py` file:

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt = fast_app()

@rt
def index():
    return H1("Hello, world!")

serve()
```

And create the `requirements.txt` file:

``` python
python-fasthtml
```

✅ Complete: Create your app files

### Deploy your app

Now that you’ve created your app files, you’re ready to deploy! From
your `plash-tutorial` directory, run: `plash_deploy`

This command will: 1. Package your application files 2. Upload them to
Plash’s servers 3. Build and deploy your application

``` bash
plash_deploy
```

    Initializing deployment...
    ✅ Upload complete! Your app is currently being built.
    It will be live at https://example-app.pla.sh

**Note:** You’ll see a different url that has been randomly generated
for your app.

✅ Complete: Deploy your app

### View your app

Your app will take a few seconds to deploy. Once it’s ready, you can:

1.  Open the provided URL directly in your browser, or
2.  Use the convenient view command to open it automatically:

``` bash
plash_view
```

    Opening browser to view app :
    https://example-app.pla.sh

When you visit that page you should see “Hello, World!”
